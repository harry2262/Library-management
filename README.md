# Library Management System

This is a C language console-based program designed to manage the operations of a library. The program allows the user to add, remove, issue, and submit books, as well as view the list of available and issued books.

## Features

- Add new books to the library's catalog
- View the list of available books
- Remove books from the library's catalog
- Issue books to students
- View the list of issued books
- Submit issued books back to the library

## Usage

The program runs in a console or command-line interface. The user can interact with the program through a series of text-based menus and prompts, entering data and commands using the keyboard.

To use the program, compile and run it using a C compiler. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform various operations.

## Data Storage

The program stores data in files, allowing for easy retrieval and updating of information. The data is stored in two files: `books.txt` and `students.txt`. The `books.txt` file stores information about the library's catalog of books, while the `students.txt` file stores information about issued books.
